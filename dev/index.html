        "Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be
        destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape
        for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are
        you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.
        What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or
        smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? The
        Death Star plans are not in the main computer." -C-3PO Episode IV

        our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope."
